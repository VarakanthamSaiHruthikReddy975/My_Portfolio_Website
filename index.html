<p>
    During my Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering from CVR College Of Engineering, from doing Procedural Programming in C to working with Object Oriented Programming in Java, from creating simple databases to manipulating complex data in databases, I was able to develop strong technical skills.
</p>

<p>
    With an aim of developing business skills along with strong technical skills, I decided to do my masters in Management Information Systems in UIC, Chicago, IL, from working in Individual Case Write-ups to Group Case Study presentations, from understanding data in simple datasets to providing recommendation systems for Complex Datasets in case studies, constructing various ML Models, I developed invaluable Business Skills which are important for any Organization's success. 
</p>

<p>
    I strongly believe process is more important than result and whichever role in Data Analytics I get into, I am ready to acquire knowledge by solving various business problems and add value to any organization I get into. You can know more about my expertise from my Resume and Github profile down below my Summary
